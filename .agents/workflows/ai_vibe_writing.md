# AI Vibe Writing Loop Workflow

This workflow orchestrates the multi-agent writing loop described in the AI Vibe Writing Skill. It automates the process of creating an outline, drafting content, reviewing, and refining it without requiring manual IDE prompting.

## Pre-requisites
- Ensure the user has an initialized `.ai_context` folder with `style_profile.md` and `custom_specs.md` customized to their needs.
- Ensure any necessary long-term memories or reference libraries are already populated.

## Steps

1. **Analyze the Request**: 
   - Read `.ai_context/custom_specs.md` and `.ai_context/style_profile.md` to understand the target audience, tone, and formatting rules.
   - Read `.ai_context/error_log.md` to understand what NOT to do.

2. **Document Spec Generation (Spec Coding)**:
   - Read `.ai_context/document_spec_template.md`.
   - Create or update `.ai_context/document_spec.md` with the core arguments, negative constraints, and evidence requirements.
   - Ask the user to review and approve the document spec. **Do NOT proceed further until the user approves.**

3. **Outline Management** (Agent Role: Outline Manager):
   - Read `.ai_context/prompts/6_outline_manager_agent.md` and `.ai_context/outline_template.md`.
   - Before writing any full text, generate a structured outline based on the `document_spec.md`. The outline MUST contain `definition_of_done` constraints.
   - Save the approved outline to `.ai_context/memory/hard_memory.json` under a key like `latest_outline`.

4. **Content Drafting** (Agent Role: Content Writer):
   - Read `.ai_context/prompts/7_content_writer_agent.md`.
   - Read the generated outline from Step 2.
   - Read domain facts from `.ai_context/memory/hard_memory.json` and `.ai_context/memory/soft_memory.json`.
   - Draft the content section by section, strongly adhering to the style profile and avoiding words from the error log.

4. **Self-Review** (Agent Role: Content Review):
   - Read `.ai_context/prompts/8_content_review_agent.md`.
   - Review the generated draft for "AI Tone", grammar issues, and verify it aligns with the error log constraints.
   - If any major issues or "AI-sounding" phrases are detected, jump back to Step 3 and revise the draft.

5. **Final Output**:
   - Present the finalized text to the user. Ask if it meets expectations or if any new rules should be added to the `.ai_context/error_log.md`.
